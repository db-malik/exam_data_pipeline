# Data Engineering Project - Flight Data Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to conduct a thorough analysis of flight data for a given airline, along with designing a data model that can predict flight delays. The data used for this project is publicly available. you can get from : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tylerx/flights-and-airportsdata?select=flights.csv

## Prerequisites

- Installation of Apache Spark and Apache Airflow
- Git Repository

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Git repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd project_repository
   ```

2. **Set up your environment by installing Spark and Airflow.**
   # Flight Data Analysis with Apache Spark and Apache Airflow

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the installation, ensure that you have Java installed on your machine, as Apache Spark is built on top of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

## Apache Spark Installation

  ### Step 1: Download and Extract Apache Spark

    Visit the [official Apache Spark website](https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html) and download the pre-built package for Hadoop. Choose the version that suits your requirements.

    ```bash
    tar -zxvf spark-<version>-bin-hadoop<version>.tgz
    ```

    Replace <version> with the specific version numbers in the filename.

2. **Set up your environment by installing Spark and Airflow.**

3. **Follow the instructions in the README to execute the data pipeline.**

## Apache Spark Data Preparation

1. **Ingest data into Spark DataFrames:**

   ```bash
   spark-submit scripts/data_ingestion.py
   ```

2. **Clean and prepare the data using Spark operations:**

   ```bash
   spark-submit scripts/data_preparation.py
   ```

3. **Evaluate the quality of data and perform necessary preparations:**

   ```bash
   spark-submit scripts/data_quality_evaluation.py
   ```

## Machine Learning Model

1. **Design and train a machine learning model using SparkML:**

   ```bash
   spark-submit scripts/machine_learning.py
   ```

2. **Evaluate the model and perform testing:**

   ```bash
   spark-submit scripts/model_evaluation.py
   ```

## Apache Airflow Orchestration

1. **Orchestrate the entire data pipeline using Apache Airflow:**

   ```bash
   airflow trigger_dag flight_pipeline
   ```
